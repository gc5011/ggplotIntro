# Pimp my plot: An intro to plotting in R using ggplot

# Setup

## Install packages

In rStudio, open and run `libraries.R`. This script will install the packages needed for working with ggplot.

This only needs to be done once for each installation of rStudio. You can skip this step if you already have these packages installed.

## Load the packages and the data

In rStudio, open and run `setup.R`.
